 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]'
 *
 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1
 * represents land and 0 represents water.
 * 
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid
 * is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e.,
 * one or more connected land cells).
 * 
 * The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the
 * water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid
 * is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter
 * of the island.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[0,1,0,0],
 * ⁠[1,1,1,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0,0],
 * ⁠[1,1,0,0]]
 * 
 * Output: 16
 * 
 * Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
